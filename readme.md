These are the projects for my "Algorithmic Thinking", written in Python. Below are quick descriptions of each project.

1. Network Resilience: 
Finds the size of the largest connected component within a community and analyzes how attacks affect the connected size. Tested and plotted random and targetted attacks from three different styles: (1) Erdos-Renyi, (2) Undirected Preferential Attachment, and (3) RF7.


2. Community Structure: 
Calculates the modularity of a community structure by measuring its flow value and shortest-path-based-betweeness value. Takes in Facebook user data to calculate the modularity of the community structure and analyzes how partitions within the community affect said modularity.


3. Infection Transmission: 
Compute the RDMST (rooted directed minimum spanning tree) through edge weight modification and contracting cycles. Uses the calculated RDMST with patient epidemiological + genetic data to simulate and predict the bacteria transmission map as a weighted digraph.


4. Sequence Alignment: 
Uses dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment betwen two DNA sequences. Calculates the null distribution and analyzes the effects of global vs local optimality.
